      <div class="concept-name">What is the web?</div>
        <!-- Andy's concept-description = Kenzo's concept-summary-->
        <div class="concept-summary"></div>
         <p>The world wide web is the world's largest computer network and collection of <span class="italic-weight">HTML documents</span>. 
         It is the result of many computers communicating with one another.</p>
         <p>When you open a <span class="italic-weight">webpage</span>, your computer sends a <span class="italic-weight">
         HTTP Request</span> to a <span class="italic-weight">Server</span> that hosts
         the <span class="italic-weight">HMTL Documents</span> for that site. 
         The <span class="italic-weight">Server</span> then sends the 
         <span class="italic-weight">HTML Documents</span> back to your computer
         where a <span class="italic-weight">Web Browser</span>
         interprets and displays the document on your screen.</p>
         <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj6EHgSsx_U">This video</a>
         provides a quick explanation.</p>

      <div class="concept-name">HTML</div>
        <div class="concept-summary"></div>
         <p><span class="italic-weight">HTML</span> stands for <span class="italic-weight">Hyper
         Text Markup Language</span>. 
         <span class="italic-weight">HTML documents</span> are the basis
         for almost every webpage. Each document contains
         <span class="italic-weight">text content</span> describing "what you
         see" and <span class="italic-weight">markup</span> describing "what
         it looks like and how the webpage is arranged". These documents can
         also refer to other documents like images, video, and music. Hyperlinks or simply 'links'
         to other pages can be included as well; making the web, weblike. 
         <p><span class="italic-weight">HTML documents</span> are the structure of a webpage and communicate to the browser how the elements are to be arranged and displayed.</p>
         <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-DcbaBDvTM"> This video
         </a> sums it up nicely.</p>

      <div class="concept-name">Tags and Elements</div>
        <div class="concept-summary"></div>
         <p><span class="italic-weight">HTML documents</span> are made of multiple <span class="italic-weight">
         HTML elements</span>. These <span class="italic-weight">
         elements</span> are <span class="italic-weight">individual components</span> that can have their attributes specified to display what the programmer wants to convey. Programmers use <span class="italic-weight">HTML tags</span>, the keywords that define how a browser must format and display content, to convey these messages.</p>
         <p><span class="italic-weight">Tags</span> are defined by an <span class="italic-weight">opening tag</span>, the content you want to show, and a <span class="italic-weight">closing tag</span>. Each line of <span class="italic-weight">HTML</span> can contain multiple <span class="italic-weight">elements</span> to present what the programmer wants to display.

         <p><a href="http://schoolsofweb.com/wp-content/uploads/anatomy-of-an-html-element.jpg" target="blank">This image</a> is a great example of an 'h1' <span class="italic-weight">tag</span> and how weblike the web can be by clicking on the link, as discussed in the previous topic.
          </p>
         <p>Some <span class="italic-weight">tags</span> don't require a <span class="italic-weight">closing tag</span>. They are called <span class="italic-weight">void tag</span>. Google's Styleguide states that you<span class="italic-weight"> should not</span> close <span class="italic-weight">void tags</span>. There is no set rule or thought regarding the closing a <span class="italic-weight">void tag</span></p>

      <div class="concept-name">Computers are Stupid, Syntax is Law</div>
        <div class="concept-summary"></div>
         <p>Computers do not have the human ability of abstract 
         thinking, therefore they interpret instructions a programmer communicates literally.
         A small mistake or typo by the programmer can lead to huge problems
         in a program. You must write with the correct 
         <span class="italic-weight">syntax</span> for the computer to
         produce exactly what you want to display.</p>
         <p><span class="italic-weight">Syntax</span> is the spelling and grammar of a programming language. The computer expects you to type in the <span class="italic-weight">exact form</span> of the language you are writing. That <span class="italic-weight">exact form</span> is called the <span class="italic-weight">syntax</span> of the programming language.</p>
         <p>A good practice is to close appropriate <span class="italic-weight">tags</span> as soon as possible.</p>
        
    </div>
    <div class="graphpaper">
      <div class="concept-name">Inline Vs. Block Elements</div>
        <div class="concept-summary"></div>
         <p><span class="italic-weight">HTML elements</span> are either <span class="italic-weight">inline</span>
         or <span class="italic-weight">block</span>.</p>
         <p><span class="italic-weight">Block elements</span> create 
         an "invisible box" around the content allowing you to change
         height and width of content, as well as many other attributes. <span class="italic-weight">Inline elements</span> are not as fancy. They typically only contain <span class="italic-weight">text</span> and other <span class="italic-weight">inline elements</span>. 
        </p>
        <p>The <span class="italic-weight">syntax</span> regarding these <span class="italic-weight">elements</span> is vast and there are no strict rules due to the context they may be used, however you can think of <span class="italic-weight">block elements</span> as <span class="italic-weight">structural elements</span> and <span class="italic-weight">inline elements</span> as <span class="italic-weight">text-based elements</span>.</p>

     <h2>Lesson 2: Creating a Structured Document with HTML</h2>
      
         <div class="graphpaper">
          <div class="concept-name">Think of a Webpage as a House</div>
            <div class="concept-summary"></div>
          <p><span class="italic-weight">HTML documents</span> define the <span class="italic-weight">structure</span> of a <span class="italic-weight">website</span>. On a blueprint, the <span class="italic-weight">individual components</span> of a home <span class="italic-weight">structure</span> are defined by names; living room, roof, balcony, etc. The same idea applies to <span class="italic-weight">HTML documents</span>. When the <span class="italic-weight">individual components</span> of a webpage <span class="italic-weight">structure</span> are defined, using 'span' or 'div' <span class="italic-weight">tags</span> for example, you can apply <span class="italic-weight">style</span> to the specific <span class="italic-weight">individual components</span> you have named. 
          </p>
          <p>
          <span class="italic-weight">CSS</span> stands for <span class="italic-weight">Cascading Style Sheets</span>. It is a language used for defining the <span class="italic-weight">style</span> of a <span class="italic-weight">webpage</span>. As blueprint would define the dimensions, angles and appearance of the home <span class="italic-weight">structure</span>, <span class="italic-weight">CSS</span> defines the color, layout, font, and many other attributes of a <span class="italic-weight">webpage</span>. It allows adaptation to different devices, screen sizes, or printers.
           <span class="italic-weight">CSS</span> is <span class="italic-weight">independent</span> of <span class="italic-weight">HTML</span> and can be used with any <span class="italic-weight">XML-based markup language</span>. 
          </p>
          <p>
          <span class="italic-weight">JavaScript Files</span> are the <span class="italic-weight">interactive components</span> of a <span class="italic-weight">webpage</span>. In this example, the blueprint has been folded up, our structure and style are complete. Now it's time to add the <span class="italic-weight">interactive components</span>, like furniture and appliances to our home. Some examples of <span class="italic-weight">interactive components</span> on a <span class="italic-weight">webpage</span> are popup windows, jump menus, alert boxes, and image rollovers. <span class="italic-weight">Javascript</span> adds automation, animation, and interactivity to webpages.  
          </p> 
          <p>These are the three <span class="italic-weight">programming languages</span> that go into <span class="italic-weight">web development</span>.</p>

   <div class="graphpaper">
    <div class="concept-name">Document Object Model</div>
      <div class="concept-summary"></div>
          <p>The <span class="italic-weight">Document Object Model</span> or <span class="italic-weight">DOM</span> is a way to represent and interact with a <span class="italic-weight">webpage</span>. The <span class="italic-weight">nodes</span> or <span class="italic-weight">HTML elements</span> of the document are organized into a <span class="italic-weight">tree structure</span>, called the <span class="italic-weight">DOM tree</span>. The <span class="italic-weight">nodes</span> in the <span class="italic-weight">DOM tree</span> are organized starting with the '!DOCTYPE html' <span class="italic-weight">node</span> and continuing down as the page is <span class="italic-weight">structured</span>.</p>

          <p><a href="http://www.kcshadow.net/_images/domd.png" target="dom image">This image</a> is a simple way to understand this concept. The <span class="italic-weight">DOM</span> is a visual breakdown of a <span class="italic-weight">webpage</span>.

All the <span class="italic-weight">elements</span> that create a <span class="italic-weight">webpage</span> are in <span class="italic-weight">rectangular boxes</span>. Thinking of items on a <span class="italic-weight">webpage</span> in terms of <span class="italic-weight">boxes</span> makes programming <span class="italic-weight">easier</span>. There is much to learn about this concept and we will cover it in Lesson Three.</p>
            <p> Right now, just be aware of this concept and know that it is important when understanding web development.</p>

       <p>When reading an <span class="italic-weight">HTML document</span> in Google's Developer Tools, for example, you will see indentations on the left side of the document before an <span class="italic-weight">element</span> begins.
       The further indented an element is, the deeper it is nested in the corresponding <span class="italic-weight">box</span>.

        <div class="concept-name">DRY, "Don't Repeat Yourself...or else!"</div>
         <div class="concept-summary"></div>
         <p>A key principle of software development is <span class="italic-weight">DRY</span>.
          It's an acronym meaning <span class="italic-weight">"Don't Repeat Yourself."</span>. The purpose is to <span class="italic-weight">reduce repetition</span> of information, making software systems easier to control.</p>
          <p>In <span class="italic-weight">CSS</span> this means using <span class="italic-weight">reusable classes</span> for <span class="italic-weight">elements</span> that are going to have the <span class="italic-weight">same style</span>, rather than writing the <span class="italic-weight">style</span> for <span class="italic-weight">each element</span>. The benefit of this concept is clear, however there is much written about this if you want an in depth explanation.</p>

        <div class="concept-name">Inheritance</div>
         <div class="concept-summary"></div>
         <p><span class="italic-weight">Inheritance</span> is a mechanism which applies <span class="italic-weight">properties</span> to  an <span class="italic-weight">ancestor element</span> and it's <span class="italic-weight">descendant elements</span> as well. <span class="italic-weight">Descendant elements</span> are the <span class="italic-weight">elements enclosed</span> by <span class="italic-weight">ancestor elements</span>. There are no specific <span class="italic-weight">descendant</span> or <span class="italic-weight">ancestor element</span>, their status is simply determined by their <span class="italic-weight">placement</span> in the <span class="italic-weight">DOM</span>.<span class="italic-weight"> Descendant elements</span> can <span class="italic-weight">inherit</span> the <span class="italic-weight">CSS properties</span> from any <span class="italic-weight">ancestor element</span> enclosing them. Generally, <span class="italic-weight">descendant elements</span> inherit <span class="italic-weight">text-related</span> properties such as font, line breaks, and color among others. <span class="italic-weight">Box-related</span> properties such as height, border style, padding etc. are <span class="italic-weight">not</span> inherited.</p>
         <p><span class="italic-weight">Inheritance</span> prevents certain properties from being repeated, allowing programmers to write less CSS. There are opposing thoughts to allowing <span class="italic-weight">inheritance</span> in CSS. Just like closing void tags, there is <span class="italic-weight">no</span> set rule or practice regarding this as well.</p>

         <p>In <span class="italic-weight">CSS</span> you first write a <span class="italic-weight">selector</span>. When you write <span class="italic-weight">HTML</span>, you give <span class="italic-weight">class names</span> to the parts of the <span class="italic-weight">document</span> you will apply <span class="italic-weight">style</span> to or <span class="italic-weight">modify</span>. These <span class="italic-weight">class names</span> are the <span class="italic-weight">selector</span>.</p>
         
         <p>There are various ways to identify <span class="italic-weight">selectors</span>. <a href="https://css-tricks.com/attribute-selectors/">This article</a> provides an great explanation of <span class="italic-weight">selectors</span>.

        <div class="concept-name">The Box Model</div>
         <div class="concept-summary"></div>
          <p>Each <span class="italic-weight">HTML element</span> is a <span class="italic-weight">box</span> that contains four components. These components will be described as Google Chrome represents them within developer tools.
          They are as follows:</p>

          <p><span class="italic-weight">Content</span>, <span class="italic">the blue box</span> - This is the <span class="italic-weight">image</span> or <span class="italic-weight">text</span> appearing on a webpage. It is the <span class="italic-weight">nucleus</span> of an <span class="italic-weight">HTML element</span> and sits at the center of the <span class="italic-weight">box</span>. The other components protect it so that other <span class="italic-weight">elements</span> don't overlap or sit too close to the <span class="italic-weight">element</span> .</p>

          <p><span class="italic-weight">Padding</span>, <span class="italic">the green box</span> - This clears an area around the <span class="italic-weight">content</span> and is affected by the <span class="italic-weight">background color</span> of the <span class="italic-weight">box</span>. It's the space inside the <span class="italic-weight">box</span> that protects the <span class="italic-weight">content</span> directly.</p>

          <p><span class="italic-weight">Border</span>, <span class="italic">the yellow box</span> - Surrounds <span class="italic-weight">padding</span> and <span class="italic-weight">content</span>. <span class="italic-weight">Border</span> is <span class="italic-weight">inherited</span> from the <span class="italic-weight">color property</span> of the <span class="italic-weight">box</span>.</p>

          <p><span class="italic-weight">Margin</span>, <span class="italic">the orange box</span> - This clears an area around the <span class="italic-weight">border</span>, it's transparent. Basically the space between <span class="italic-weight">boxes</span>.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="graphpaper">
        <div class="concept-name">Box Size</div>
         <div class="concept-summary"></div>
         <p>When you are <span class="italic-weight">sizing boxes</span> there are two techniques for dealing with <span class="italic-weight">sizing issues</span>.</p>
         <p>- Set <span class="italic-weight">box sizes</span> in terms of <span class="italic-weight">percentage</span> rather than <span class="italic-weight">pixels</span>. This will display the content depending on the <span class="italic-weight">size</span> of the screen. When set by <span class="italic-weight">pixels</span>, the content will <span class="italic-weight">remain</span> that exact size, <span class="italic-weight">regardless</span> of screen size.</p>
         
         <p>- Set <span class="italic-weight">box-sizing</span> attribute to <span class="italic-weight">border-box</span>.
         This makes the <span class="italic-weight">sum</span> of the <span class="italic-weight">element size</span> include the <span class="italic-weight">border and padding</span>, making it <span class="italic-weight">easier</span> to make <span class="italic-weight">layouts</span> for the webpage.</p>

         <p>By setting a <span class="italic-weight">max width</span> for a box, the box can become <span class="italic-weight">smaller</span> if necessary, but never go <span class="italic-weight">larger</span> than specified.
         </p>

    <div class="graphpaper">
        <div class="concept-name">Box Positioning</div>
         <div class="concept-summary"></div>     
        <p><span class="italic-weight">Div tags</span> are <span class="italic-weight">block elements</span>. By <span class="italic-weight">default</span> they will take the <span class="italic-weight">entire width</span> of a page. Adding the rule <span class="italic-weight">"display: flex;"</span> to the appropriate <span class="italic-weight">selector</span> will <span class="italic-weight">override</span> the <span class="italic-weight">default</span> and allows <span class="italic-weight">div tags</span> to appear <span class="italic-weight">next</span> to each other.

         <p>To add the images to a webpage use the tag <span class="italic-weight">"img"</span> and provide the <span class="italic-weight">source</span>.</p>

        <p>- Get the <span class="italic-weight">structure </span>of the page <span class="italic-weight">right</span>. This can be done by <span class="italic-weight">visually "boxifying"</span>. <span class="italic-weight">Then</span> move on to <span class="italic-weight">tags</span>. If something needs to be fixed, fix it, like headers for example.</p>
        <p>- Think about the <span class="italic-weight">size</span> of the <span class="italic-weight">boxes</span>. How <span class="italic-weight">big</span> should they be?</p>
        <p>- How do you want the <span class="italic-weight">boxes</span> to be <span class="italic-weight">positioned</span> on the screen? Make the changes <span class="italic-weight">necessary</span> to do this.</p>
        <p>- Once the layout is <span class="italic-weight">complete</span>, look at the <span class="italic-weight">smaller details</span>. These can be <span class="italic-weight">polished</span> until the webpage looks like the <span class="italic-weight">design given</span>.</p>
        <p>It is important that <span class="italic-weight">HTML</span> and <span class="italic-weight">CSS</span> are <span class="italic-weight">correct</span> and <span class="italic-weight">comply</span> with <span class="italic-weight">standards</span>.
